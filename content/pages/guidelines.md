Summary: General guidelines for this blog space


# Welcome!

These are the operating guidelines I plan to use for operating this blog space and enforcing standards into its contents. **These guidelines are not set in stone, and may change over time.**


## Guideline 1: Learning, Growing, Mentoring, Sharing
This is serious, folks. It doesn't matter if you are a seasoned CEO or a entry-level front line worker. I am loaded with a lot of experience, and everyone deserves to learn (or be intransigent) any of it they want to without any negativity from other people. If you disagree with me and want to say so, do so politely and try to make fair points. As well, be polite even if you agree with me. After all, I might have a lot of experience, but I don't always share the same perspectives or experience as others, and I want to learn from your perspectives as well.

Also, feel free to share this blog on LinkedIn and add your point of view or comments there when you do. Love it or hate it, LinkedIn is the largest "professionals" social network, and this blog is *mostly* about the professional-side of software engineering.


## Guideline 2: General Content

As a Senior level Software Engineer, specializing in backend technologies and automation using Python and other tools, posts on this blog are mostly going to cover subjects related to this career field and industry. Though, it is my blog, and I have a lot of interests, so I might just throw the occasional deviation post up here about something completely different. You don't have to read it, if you don't want to. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Guideline 3: AI Generated Content

**"AI!"**

Quick! Someone call a VC, I just said their favorite buzzword! No, seriously, AI is both a boon and a curse for software engineers. But this isn't where I want to get straight into the controversy of AI. Instead, allow me to outline my stance on AI.

AI is a tool, and if used correctly at the appropriate times, it can be a very very very useful and time-saving tool. However, modern AI is in its infancy. It has limits. It has a stigma. So, my stance is simple. I will use AI in my projects and even these posts, but I won't freely let AI roam free here. Anything generated by an AI will be marked as AI and I will provide the context I used to generate the AI content, if it makes sense to do so. I'm also going to be a nerd about it, and post any AI text as a code block containing pseudo-HTML. As an example, I asked ChatGPT to explain the point of this blog:

```html
<AI model="Chat-GPT GPT-4o" unaltered="True" input=
"Write a one paragraph short blurb for my first blog post in this blog. Have it generalize several of the most controversial topics in software engineering into simple phrases for the paragraph.">

Welcome to my blog, where we’ll explore the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering, from the thrilling debates about tabs vs. spaces to the deeper questions of remote work versus office culture. We’ll dive into the art of balancing innovation with technical debt, unravel the complexities of AI’s role in the future of development, and tackle the timeless dilemma of scaling teams without losing the spark of creativity. Whether you’re here to learn about the job market, seek career growth strategies, or find guidance on mentoring the next generation of developers, this space is your compass in navigating the challenges and opportunities of our field. Let’s build, break, and rebuild better—together.</AI>
```

Umm, sure. Chat-GPT sure does have a unique way with words. It *sounds* nice, but its a completely different way of speaking, and stands out. Of course, I could have added more instruction to the input, and kept tweaking it until I got the output that looked right, but I will save that discussion for another time. Just know, AI is here to stay, and whether you like it or not, we all have to learn to live with it, and maybe even compete with it.
