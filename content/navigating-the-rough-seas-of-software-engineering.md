# Navigating the Rough Seas of Software Engineering

"AI!"

Quick! Someone call a VC, I just said their favorite buzzword! No, seriously, AI is both a boon and a curse for software engineers. But I don't want to get straight into the fray on this first post, so allow me to just outline my guideline on how this site is based.


## Guideline 1: Learning, Growing, Mentoring
This is serious, folks. It doesn't matter if you are a seasoned CEO or a entry-level front line worker. I am loaded with a lot of experience, and everyone deserves to learn or be concerned with any of it. If you disagree with me and want to say so, do so politely and try to make fair points. Be polite, even if you agree with me, too. After all, I might have a lot of experience, but I don't always share the same perspectives or experience as others, and I want to learn and grow, too.


## Guideline 2: General Content

As a Senior level Software Engineer, specializing in backend technologies and automation using Python and other tools, posts on this blog are mostly going to cover subjects related to this career field and industry. Though, it is my blog, and I have a lot of interests, so I might just throw the occasional deviation post up here about something completely different.

*“The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails.”* - William Arthur Ward


## Guideline 2: AI Generated Content

AI is a tool, and if used correctly at the appropriate times, it can be a very very very useful and time-saving tool. However, AI is in its infancy. It has limits. It has a stigma. So, my stance is simple. I will use AI in my projects and even these posts, but I won't freely let AI roam free here. Anything generated by an AI will be marked as AI and I will provide the context I used to generate the AI content, if it makes sense to do so. I'm also going to be a nerd about it, and post any AI text as a code block containing psuedo-HTML. As an example, I asked ChatGPT to explain the point of this blog post:

### Example AI Content "First post to describe this blog"
```html
<AI model="Chat-GPT GPT-4o" unaltered="True" input=
"Write a one paragraph short blurb for my first blog post in this blog. Have it generalize several of the most controversial topics in software engineering into simple phrases for the paragraph.">

Welcome to my blog, where we’ll explore the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering, from the thrilling debates about tabs vs. spaces to the deeper questions of remote work versus office culture. We’ll dive into the art of balancing innovation with technical debt, unravel the complexities of AI’s role in the future of development, and tackle the timeless dilemma of scaling teams without losing the spark of creativity. Whether you’re here to learn about the job market, seek career growth strategies, or find guidance on mentoring the next generation of developers, this space is your compass in navigating the challenges and opportunities of our field. Let’s build, break, and rebuild better—together.</AI>

Umm, sure, Chat-GPT, I might post about that stuff, but only time will tell.
